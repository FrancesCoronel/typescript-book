# Proposal Guidelines

> When sending us a proposal, please include the following:

## An overview of your proposed book.

> Tell us what you’d like to write about and why we should consider publishing on this topic. Explain what you’ll cover in your book and how you’ll organize it. Describe your book’s audience and why they need this book. Why is your book different? Having purchased this book, what will readers be able to do that they couldn’t do before? Most importantly, tell us why we should get excited about your topic.

Extend JavaScript's features by using the more mature and powerful TypeScript.

Why is TypeScript getting so popular? Key development frameworks depend on it and it improves developer productivity in the ever-changing JavaScript world.

Build enterprise-ready, industrial strength web applications using TypeScript and leading JavaScript frameworks

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## A draft outline.

> Take the ideas from your proposal and organize them into chapters. Then, for each chapter, include a few sentences explaining what subjects you’ll cover in that chapter. Give us a sense of how many pages you plan for your book to be.

## Competing books.

> Let us know what books compete with yours, and how yours would be different and better.

All these books focus entirely on TypeScript, were published within the last 2 years and have gotten 4 stars or better on review sites.

## Sample chapter.

> We’d also like to review a 20-page writing sample from your proposed book.
