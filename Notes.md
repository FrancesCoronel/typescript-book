Before you start, consider using an editor with good typescript support.

VS Code (below) is a popular option. Editors with typescript support can provide helpful autocomplete, inline documentation, and code refactoring features.

JavaScript is old and its dynamic nature can make it very difficult to build large applications in a maintainable way. But, add the immense power of compile-type static typing and all of the sudden you've got an enterprise-ready language that saves you from many common JavaScript issues and actually makes web development an enjoyable experience. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript - completely compatible in every way, yet it brings the language to a whole new level.

JavaScript is the defacto language of the world. TypeScript is JavaScript, only better.

Join experienced coder, Jess Chadwick, as he explores the world of TypeScript. Starting with the basics and fundamental ECMAScript 2015 features that TypeScript expands upon, Jess shows you all the ways that TypeScript allows you to bring your JavaScript development to the next level.
